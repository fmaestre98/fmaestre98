# Hello there‚Äºüëãüë®‚Äçüíª

I am a passionate software developer with over 1 year of experience, specializing in backend and mobile development. My journey in programming began in 2016 when I enrolled at the University of Informatics Sciences to pursue a degree in Computer Science Engineering. During my university years, I actively participated in programming events and competitions such as the Global Game Jam and the ICPC competitions, qualifying twice for the Caribbean finals.

I completed professional internships during my third and fourth year of studies, where I worked with PHP and Extjs to develop plugins for ProccesMaker. Amid the COVID-19 quarantine and the transition to remote classes in my final year of studies, I secured my first professional remote job with a startup. Despite academic and work responsibilities, I temporarily had to leave my job and school to fulfill 18 months of active military service, aiming to free myself from certain military obligations.

Upon completing my military service, I rejoined the same startup team in a remote capacity and subsequently began working on my thesis, the final requirement for obtaining a degree in Computer Science Engineering. My dedication to software development, ability to adapt to new challenges, and experience in remote work environments have allowed me to grow professionally and successfully tackle various projects and responsibilities.
