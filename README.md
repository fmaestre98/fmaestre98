# Hello there‚Äºüëãüë®‚Äçüíª

I am a passionate software developer with over two years of professional experience, specializing in backend and mobile development. My programming journey began in 2016 when I enrolled at the University of Informatics Sciences to pursue a degree in Computer Science Engineering. Throughout my university years, I actively participated in programming events and competitions, including the Global Game Jam and the ICPC, where I qualified twice for the Caribbean finals. I gained valuable experience during my professional internships in my third and fourth years, developing plugins for ProcessMaker using PHP and ExtJS. My primary expertise lies in backend development with Java and mobile development with Flutter, but I am also very interested in Kotlin technologies, including native Android development and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), as well as their applications in backend development.
